                    When a Fire/or Special Peril occurs the Insured is expected within fifteen days after, at the latest
                     to deliver to the Company an Account of the several articles or matters damaged or destroyed by Fire/or Special Peril; with the
                      estimated Cash Value of each of them respectively immediately before the Loss. When Property hereby insured is only partially damaged by Fire/or
                       Special Peril, no abandonment thereof will be allowed unless by consent of the Company or its Agents.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The Cash Value of property destroyed or damaged by Fire/or Special Peril shall in no case exceed what would be the cost to the insured of replacing 
                    the same; and in case of the depreciation of such property from use, or otherwise, a corresponding deduction shall be made from the cost of 
                    replacement in other to ascertain the actual Cash Value immediately before the Fire/or Special Peril.
                </p>
